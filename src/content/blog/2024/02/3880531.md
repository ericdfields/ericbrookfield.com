Did you never tell your phone, "Hey Siri, scan a document," and then watch it pull up the document scanning UI? You didn't buy an app, you weren't marketed to or tracked, you didn't do anything except say "Phone Do Scanner Now."

After scanning, did you fail to use your voice to dictate the filename "ThatKid's Important Document?"

When you uploaded the thing to the place, did you notice how you didn't have to search anywhere for that file? That it was in the right place already?

Did you ask it if David Cronenberg is Canadian, only to get a perfect sentence with attribution from a reputable source showing that yes, the D-Man is indeed Canadian?

Did you forget we live in an age of miracles?

Is perfection the only acceptable outcome?
