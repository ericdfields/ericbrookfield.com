> Boss: Do we think if we make these changes that this content will now be above the fold?

> Me: You know, when I fold my laptop the screen shuts off and I can't use the keyboard. This is going to be the case for a lot of our users too. It's good enough content as stands; I really don't think its worth considering the fold.
