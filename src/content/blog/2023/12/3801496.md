I’m the Her (2013) guy now. 

ChatGPT and the whole AI thing… there’s some problems. Some real problems. Take it as read. 

But have you used the voice chat function of the ChatGPT app bluetooth’d to your car while cruising around? 

Much like the initial chatbot release of version 3, there’s a “holy shit” moment at first. You can do some neat parlor tricks. Use it some more with a critical mind and you’ll find it doesn’t do some things as well as it should. But for some tasks, it’s a very useful tool! Not essential, but useful. Then there’s voice chat. 

It’s the same chatbot experience, but you’re just asking questions and responding to answers. The voice is obviously generative but I picked the one that sounds the most like Scarlet Johansson because I’m a 38 year old cis white male that’s why

You can go back and forth with questions or prompts just like you would with a person. A person who can give you answers to what’s on your mind, or at least generate a string of conversation-sounding-tones, not unlike a musical synthesizer but the music happens to be the answer of a verbal spell you cast.  But once you actually establish a conversational cadence, an uncanny valley of voice communication takes hold and, like the typing bot experience, you find the edges of its usefulness.
