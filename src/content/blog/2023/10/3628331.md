just because you want to be studio boy with logic pro doesn't mean you take your eye off the ball: batch processing a bunch of stem-based audio projects from a digital mixer (zoom livetrak, tascam models, etc) into something you can listen to for quick reference. 

that's the goal i wanted to achieve.

that's not a job for logic pro, that's a job for a robot. a software robot. and you write software robot things and can figure out how to do stuff, but these days you have chatgpt.

[just look what me and the robot made in like 30 minutes](https://gist.github.com/ericdfields/c0c0d3b57a7d32e5f2a03d3b5f2ed701).

look at what my virtual robot music wife now does for me:

wow! look — i could have coded something that does this but python is not my first language, nor second nor third, so it would have taken time. i did this just by typing for the length of a friends rerun (with commercials). while high.

this is a gosh darn tootin' excellent deployment of technology, if you ask me. 

## but the copyrights

to say this takes away a task from an audio engineer or even one who can script logic pro (I assume you can, maybe you can't) is stupid because i was never going to pay someone to do this. maybe i'd just find time to scrub through some wav files, totally manually.

this really unlocks a level of DIY audio workstation tooling for anyone, and substitute "audio" for whatever digital ingredients you feel like feeding the robots. when you work with these machines intentionally to generate something specific to your needs — and if you _succeed_ in extracting value from the work — what you're engaging in is so far refined from its source material (the training dataset), to call any part of it copyright infringement is kinda insane. sorry.

it's probably icky and legally dubious what the openAIs of the world do, but genie out of the bottle etc etc, and i could just as easily have generated the above with some heirloom variety, ethically-raised LLM running locally on my mac studio. 

go ahead and use the robots. please don't be evil (like you've been doing all along right?).
