The Bear s2e6 is a pivotal episode of television. I think it was canonized in the McLuhan days that TV is a close-up medium? "Fishes" exemplifies this. There's a close up on Donna — Jamie Lee Curtis — where she makes this frown and her face looks almost skeletal… so much remorse. That was the frame that really caught my attention to the extremely intentional cinematography of the episode.

The whole season has more tight framed close ups of meaningful fascial expressions than I remember seeing in any TV show of recent memory. We still haven't finished it, but I'm assuming it's going to be my favorite season of TV for 2023. Of course, tragically, the earliest we'd hope to get resolution is probably… 2025?
