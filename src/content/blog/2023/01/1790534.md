I asked the robot:

> I'm seeding a tray of black oil sunflower seeds to grow them as micro greens. Approximately how many seeds by weight will fit on a standard 1020 tray.

and it said

> The number of seeds that will fit on a standard 1020 tray can vary depending on the size of the seeds and how densely they are packed. However, as a rough estimate, a standard 1020 tray measuring approximately 21.5 inches by 11 inches can hold around 2-3 ounces of black oil sunflower seeds.

now chatgpt is super wrong a lot, and that is rightfully getting attention as it starts to spew factually incorrect content onto the internet. in this case, it may be wrong, but at least I can easily weigh out 1, 2 or 3 ounces and quickly see if that's the right amount for the tray. The alternative is "a handful" which is what I did already and that kinda works, but efficient growing is all about dialing-in the inputs for best output with least waste.
