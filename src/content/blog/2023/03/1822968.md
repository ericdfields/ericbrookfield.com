Lately, when a website gives me guff, I just do not engage with the site. [I'm glad I'm not the only one](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618804/google-facebook-login-ads-web-design-hell).

Go further than just reading on the web. I have no tolerance for slow checkouts that want me to sign up for a website to order a [cool t-shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E458729-000/00?colorDisplayCode=31&sizeDisplayCode=005). Blame it on Shopfiy. 

I think that whenever a _dumb website script is asking you to do something_, or you become _physiologically agitated_ by the performance of a _digital experience_, it's important to take a step back and assess what value its actually providing to you. Does your attention (or your wallet) deserve better?
