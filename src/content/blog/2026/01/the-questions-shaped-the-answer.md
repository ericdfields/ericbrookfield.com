I asked an AI to help me reimagine my personal site. Not redesign — reimagine. I didn't describe a vision or list requirements. I just said "reimagine what a personal website can be."

What followed wasn't what I expected.

The AI didn't generate ideas for me to evaluate. It asked questions. Multiple choice questions, one at a time. And my answers — quick, intuitive, sometimes combining options — accumulated into something I wouldn't have designed if I'd sat down to design it.

I started with six words: "reimagine what a personal website can be."

The response wasn't a mood board or a list of trends. It was a question:

**What feels limiting about the current "sections on a page" format?**

1. It's static — visitors scroll, consume, leave
2. It's one-dimensional — everyone sees the same thing
3. It doesn't capture who I actually am
4. It's disconnected from my actual work

I picked 3. Not because I'd thought about it before — I hadn't. But seeing it phrased that way, I recognized it.

Then: **When someone spends 5 minutes with you in real life, what do they pick up on that your site misses?**

Options included how I think through problems, my taste and opinions, my sense of humor, what I'm currently obsessed with.

I said "1 and 4" — how I think, and what I'm into right now.

A few more questions. Temporal layers. A living workspace. AI-seeded, human-curated. Each answer narrowed the space until a coherent vision emerged that I couldn't have articulated at the start.

The interesting thing isn't that the AI asked good questions. It's that multiple choice questions work differently than open-ended ones.

When someone asks "what do you want your site to be?" your brain reaches for existing frames — portfolio, blog, landing page. You describe variations of things you've seen.

But when you're handed four options you didn't write, you're forced to *react*. You feel which one resonates before you can explain why. And then you've committed to something — not a final answer, but a direction that constrains the next question.

This is how the temporal site emerged. I didn't sit down with the concept of "archaeological layers" or "AI-seeded curation." I picked options that felt right. The coherence came from the accumulation of constrained choices, not from a vision I had at the start.

There's probably a name for this in design research. Structured ideation, maybe. But experiencing it with an AI collaborator felt different than a human workshop. No social pressure. No one invested in their own idea. Just questions, answers, and an outcome that surprised me.

Two hours later, I had a design document, an implementation plan, and twelve committed tasks building a site that treats time as the primary axis. Tools I've used, projects I've worked on, interests I've followed — all placed on a timeline you can scrub through like a video. AI extracts signals from my blog posts; I annotate and correct on top.

Is it better than a normal portfolio? I don't know yet. But it's *mine* in a way that feels different. Not because I designed every pixel, but because every choice in the brainstorming session was a genuine reaction. The AI didn't convince me of anything. It just kept asking until something clicked.

Maybe that's the thing worth noting: the creative process with AI isn't about generation. It's about structured discovery. The questions shaped the answer — and the answer was something I didn't know I wanted until I saw the path there.
